# Pusher CallInitiated Event - Complete Fix & Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Broadcasting Configuration

**Problem**: `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=log` was logging events instead of sending to Pusher
**Solution**: Changed to `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=pusher`

### 2. APP_URL Configuration

**Problem**: Malformed APP_URL causing URL generation errors
**Solution**: Fixed APP_URL format in .env file

### 3. Network Connectivity

**Problem**: Intermittent DNS/connectivity issues with Pusher
**Solution**: Enhanced cURL options and connectivity testing

## üîß Configuration Changes Made

### .env file updates:

```properties
# Fixed broadcasting
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=pusher
BROADCAST_DRIVER=pusher

# Fixed APP_URL
APP_URL=http://localhost
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=6Leruz4rAAAAAE2JdNyra8aZzFCPK93ui99Hxd_b

# Pusher config (already correct)
PUSHER_APP_ID=1471502
PUSHER_APP_KEY=0e0b5123273171ff212d
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=770b5206be41b096e258
PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=eu
```

### Enhanced broadcasting.php:

-   Added improved cURL options for better connectivity
-   Enhanced timeout and connection settings

## üß™ Testing Your CallInitiated Event

### Method 1: Use the Call Initiate Endpoint

```bash
POST {{baseUrl}}/api/v1/calls/initiate
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "conversation_id": 1,
    "call_type": "audio"
}
```

### Method 2: Monitor Pusher Debug Console

1. Go to: https://dashboard.pusher.com/apps/1471502/console
2. Subscribe to channel: `private-conversation.1` (or your conversation ID)
3. Look for event: `call.initiated`
4. Trigger a call using the endpoint above

### Method 3: Use Test Scripts

```bash
# Test basic Pusher connectivity
php test_pusher_connectivity.php

# Test CallInitiated event specifically
php test_pusher_call_event.php
```

## üì± React Native Client Testing

Your React Native app should now receive the CallInitiated events:

```javascript
// Subscribe to the conversation channel
const channel = pusher.subscribe("private-conversation.1");

// Listen for call events
channel.bind("call.initiated", (data) => {
    console.log("Incoming call received:", data);
    // Expected data:
    // {
    //   call_id: 123,
    //   call_type: "audio",
    //   agora_channel_name: "channel_name",
    //   initiator: { id, name, username, profile_url },
    //   started_at: "2025-08-08T20:00:00.000Z"
    // }
});
```

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check Laravel Logs

```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Look for broadcasting-related logs.

### 2. Check Telescope

-   Events should appear in Telescope
-   Broadcasting should show "pusher" as driver

### 3. Check Pusher Dashboard

-   Go to your Pusher app dashboard
-   Check the "Debug Console" tab
-   Trigger a call and watch for events

### 4. Network Debugging

If you still have connectivity issues, try:

```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup api-eu.pusher.com

# Test connectivity
telnet api-eu.pusher.com 443

# Try different cluster
# Update .env: PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=us2
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior

When you call `POST /api/v1/calls/initiate`:

1. **Database**: Call record created
2. **Telescope**: Event appears with pusher driver
3. **Pusher Dashboard**: Event appears in debug console
4. **React Native**: Client receives call.initiated event
5. **Response**: Successful API response with call data

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If events don't appear in Pusher:

1. Verify `BROADCAST_CONNECTION=pusher` in .env
2. Clear config cache: `php artisan config:clear`
3. Check network connectivity to Pusher
4. Try different Pusher cluster region

### If React Native doesn't receive events:

1. Verify channel subscription: `private-conversation.{id}`
2. Check authentication for private channels
3. Verify Pusher client configuration matches server

### If getting HTTP errors:

1. Check APP_URL is properly formatted
2. Verify all .env variables are correct
3. Clear all caches: `php artisan optimize:clear`

## ‚úÖ Current Status

-   ‚úÖ Broadcasting configured for Pusher
-   ‚úÖ APP_URL fixed
-   ‚úÖ Network connectivity verified
-   ‚úÖ CallInitiated event properly structured
-   ‚úÖ Test scripts available for verification

**Your CallInitiated events should now appear in the Pusher debug console!** üéâ

## üìû Next Steps

1. Test the `/calls/initiate` endpoint
2. Monitor Pusher debug console
3. Update React Native client to listen for events
4. Test end-to-end call flow

The real-time call notification system is now properly configured and should work as expected.
