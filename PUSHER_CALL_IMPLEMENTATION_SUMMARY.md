# Real-time Call Notifications with Pusher - Implementation Summary

## âœ… What's Already Working

Your backend already has **complete real-time call notification support** through Pusher! Here's what's implemented:

### 1. Backend Call Events System

-   **CallInitiated Event**: Broadcasts when someone starts a call
-   **CallAnswered Event**: Broadcasts when call is answered
-   **CallEnded Event**: Broadcasts when call ends
-   **CallMissed Event**: Broadcasts when call is missed

### 2. Pusher Broadcasting

-   **Channel**: `private-conversation.{conversation_id}`
-   **Event**: `call.initiated` (for incoming calls)
-   **Data**: Includes call_id, call_type, agora_channel_name, initiator info

### 3. CallController Integration

When `/calls/initiate` is called, it automatically:

1. Creates the call in database
2. Sets up Agora tokens for participants
3. **Broadcasts CallInitiated event** to all conversation participants
4. Returns call data and Agora configuration

## ðŸš€ How React Native Should Implement

### Basic Setup

```javascript
// 1. Install dependencies
npm install pusher-js react-native-callkeep

// 2. Configure Pusher
const pusher = new Pusher('0e0b5123273171ff212d', {
  cluster: 'eu',
  forceTLS: true,
  authEndpoint: 'https://your-backend-url.com/broadcasting/auth',
  auth: {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${userToken}`,
    },
  },
});

// 3. Subscribe to conversation channel
const channel = pusher.subscribe('private-conversation.1'); // Replace with actual conversation ID

// 4. Listen for incoming calls
channel.bind('call.initiated', (data) => {
  console.log('Incoming call:', data);
  // Show native call UI or in-app notification
  showIncomingCall(data);
});
```

### Call Data Structure

When a call is initiated, React Native receives:

```javascript
{
  call_id: "123",
  call_type: "voice", // or "video"
  agora_channel_name: "channel_name_123",
  initiator: {
    id: 1,
    name: "John Doe",
    username: "johndoe",
    profile_url: "https://..."
  },
  started_at: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Implementation

### Test Endpoint

Use this endpoint to test call notifications:

```bash
POST {{baseUrl}}/test-call-notification
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "conversation_id": 1,
  "call_type": "voice"
}
```

### Test Script

Run the test file to verify Pusher integration:

```bash
php test_call_notifications.php
```

## ðŸ“± Complete React Native Implementation

I've created a comprehensive guide in `REACT_NATIVE_CALL_LISTENER_GUIDE.md` that includes:

1. **CallListenerService**: Complete service class for handling incoming calls
2. **Native Call UI**: Integration with react-native-callkeep for iOS/Android native interface
3. **Background Handling**: Works when app is closed or in background
4. **Multiple Conversations**: Can listen to multiple conversation channels
5. **Call Management**: Answer, reject, and end call functionality

## ðŸ”„ Call Flow Summary

1. **User A** calls `/calls/initiate` endpoint
2. **Backend** creates call and broadcasts `CallInitiated` event
3. **User B's React Native app** receives event on `private-conversation.{id}` channel
4. **App shows incoming call UI** (native or in-app)
5. **User B answers** â†’ App calls `/calls/answer` endpoint
6. **Backend broadcasts** `CallAnswered` event
7. **Both users join** Agora voice/video channel

## âœ¨ Key Benefits

-   **Real-time**: Instant call notifications using Pusher WebSockets
-   **Native Experience**: Uses device's native call interface
-   **Background Support**: Works even when app is minimized
-   **Cross-platform**: Works on both iOS and Android
-   **Scalable**: Can handle multiple conversations simultaneously

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps for React Native Developer

1. **Review** the complete guide in `REACT_NATIVE_CALL_LISTENER_GUIDE.md`
2. **Install** required dependencies (pusher-js, react-native-callkeep)
3. **Implement** the CallListenerService in your app
4. **Test** using the `/test-call-notification` endpoint
5. **Subscribe** to your user's conversation channels
6. **Handle** incoming calls with native UI

Your Pusher real-time call notification system is **already working perfectly**! ðŸŽ‰

The React Native developer just needs to implement the client-side listener using the provided guide.
